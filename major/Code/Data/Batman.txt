17 @loranskinkisart @qLxke_ They aren't even on the same earth besides having a batman at the beginning of his career and a superman decade's into his career wouldn't be ideal.

1 After seeing the Batman a second time, it basically reaffirmed all my initial opinions on the film. It’s really good, just isn’t perfect. It’s either an 8 or a 9, definitely not a 10 and definitely not a 7

8 @noneutactic Recently The Batman. Nicely shot, mostly pretty well acted and some great fight scenes, but it committed the ultimate crime: it was boring. Then it compounded that by being 3 fucking hours long.
