4 @Jupiterno3u3 @AllenJBTX @DCComics What? That's not it at all.

We hate that they've ignored Superman for over 5 fucking years (apart from a headless cosplay appearance in Shazam) and this is the first attention he gets?

But sure, make this solely about Snyder not being involved.

7 And it fails because of the flimsy foundation everything is built on. The Batman v Superman stuff is cool and by cool I mean the best part about it is a 5 minute action scene and some interactions and then it turns into a fight against Doomsday and sequel bait.

Traditionally within comic book narratives, Superman's alter ego, Clark Kent, is depicted as “the mild-mannered reporter,” the persistently denigrated butt of jokes.
